<h2>

I'm currently 17 and was born in Amsterdam (AMC). 

I'm currently following a software development degree program  at Media College in Amsterdam. 
While taking this program i strive to develop my game development skills as well as myself.

<h3>

I have always been interested in making games eversince i saw a video about an indie game developer making a game from scratch.
I've tried making some games, but i just couldn't figure out how everything worked. 
That's why i came to Mediacollege, to further develop my skills in game development.
I would also love to pair those skills with my music producing skills, which i'm also working on.
Place
Since my parents parted ways about two years after my birth, i have been living with my mother in Hoorn for the past 17 years.
But since recently i moved into my father's house in Lelystad because of personal reasons.

I also skate at the local skatepark not as far from my house.

What i can already do
As you might suspect i'm pretty familiar with English
I think i'm good at producing music.
I like solving problems, so i think i'm good at coming up with solutions as well.
I am a very helpful person, because i like helping people. (At least that's what i think).
